#  AzureRmPipeline_MTC

### Description
In this repository I developed code to create a storage account and Windows Server.
I created two accounts and create update and copy 100 blobs between them.
For this task, I wrote the code in PowerShell.

### Microsoft's object resources:
#### Resource Group-
A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group

#### Storage Account-
An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, file shares, queues, tables, and disks.

#### Container-
A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system.

#### Windows VMs-
Windows Server is the platform for building an infrastructure of connected applications, networks, and web services, from the workgroup to the data center. It bridges on-premises environments with Azure, adding additional layers of security while helping you modernize your applications and infrastructure.
